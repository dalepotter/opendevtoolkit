[School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org) is on the hunt for people living in lower-income countries who want to improve and share their data skills with others in their community, to join the newest [class of School of Data Fellows.](http://schoolofdata.org/2014/05/09/we-need-you-become-a-school-of-data-fellow/) 

For people who love working with data generally, it's an incredible opportunity to join a world-renowned network of data trainers, as well as building up connections within your community with civil society organisations and journalists. 

More specifically within open development: this is a chance to dive deep into international development data, and make the data used and useful! You could, for example, work with civil society organisations in your area who are dedicated to alleviating poverty, and help them realise the potential of data that they're collecting. 

Or, use your time as a School of Data fellow to get a handle on data sets to do with poverty reduction that are becoming available from international development institutions, and work with your community to make it useful and relevant to their work. You could look into international aid flows to your area for example, or how land rights are being assigned, migration flows, health services domestically and provided through development projects... the list goes on.

To find out more about how to apply as a School of Data fellow, check out [their blog post](http://schoolofdata.org/2014/05/09/we-need-you-become-a-school-of-data-fellow/) - please share this call widely!
